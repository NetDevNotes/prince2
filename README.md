Prince2 Foundation Notes

- Principles (7)
- Themes (7) 
- Proceses (7)

# A Project Defined

Prince2 assumes there will be a Customer who specifies the desired results and a Supplier who provides resources and skills to deliver these results.

> Customer Supplier Environment

The organisation that commissions a project is *Corporate*, *Programme Mgmt* or the *Customer*.  They are also responsible for governance and realising the projects benefits.

A project can be standalone or part of a programme (and as such subject to the programmes governance, structure & reporting requirements).

> "A programme is a group of related projects which deliver outcomes and benefits related to the organisations strategy"

> "A project can be part of a portfolio of strategic objectives"

# Project Performance (6)

## 6 aspects of project performance to be managed

1. Scope (everything needed to buy/build and all the work involved in doing it.  Also include what is out of scope to set stakeholders expectations.
2. Quality (defines the standards which the delivered scope must meet to be fit for purpose)
3. Risk (things might not go to plan, positive or negative, threats or opportunities) 
4. Cost (Project budget)
6. Time (Duration of the project)
6. Benefits (Measurable improvement in BAU because of the project)

# Principles (7) 

1. Continued business justification
2. Learn from experience
3. Defined roles and responsibilities 
4. Manage by stages 
5. Manage by exception
6. Focus on products 
7. Tailor to suit the project

### More detail

1. Continued business justification (Business Case)
2. Learn from experience (learn from previous projects or previous management stages)
3. Defined roles and responsibilities (Stakeholders - Business Sponsors, Users, Suppliers (int/ext))
4. Manage by stages (discreet sequential stages, do a little work, review, do a little more, review and so on until completion.)

> "The section of the project the Project Manager is managing on behalf of the Project Board at any one time, at the end of which the Project Board will wish to review progress to date, the state of the project plan, the business case and risks, and the next stage plan, in order to decide whether to continue the project"

## Management Stages (2 minimum)

- Initiation (thinking)
- Rest of the project (doing)

Management stages could be aligned with delivery stages, such as design, build and test.

Delivery stages may overlap each other, i.e. build and training may overlap somewhat, but management stages are always sequential (mgmt-stg-1, mgmt-stg-2, mgmt-stg-3, mgmt-stg-4). 

Typically you can break up the delivery stage that crosses management stage boundaries into smaller chunks (training syllabus in mgmt-stg-1, training staff in mgmt-stg-2).

The number of stages will depend on the size and complexity of the project, the risk, organisational standard and policies and where significant decisions are needed usually before a major commitment is made, such as *awarding a contract*.

Smaller stages offer more control to the project board who are the key decision makers, but also required more effort on their part.

Benefits of Managing by Stages
- Making sure the project is properly initiated before work starts
- Giving the Project Board the opportunity to assess the projects viability at defined intervals
- Making sure key decisions are made before the work starts (such as awarding contracts)
- Clarifying the impact of external influences on the project before the go-ahead is given
- Delegating authority to the Project Manager on a stage by stage basis - *Management by Exception*

5. Manage by exception (Tolerances are set for each aspect of performance, Cost, Time, Scope, Quality, Risk, Benefits. If within tolerances o need to meet.  Immediately escalate when forecast is expected to exceed a tolerance).
6. Focus on products (focus on definition, delivery and quality requirements of products)

> Products = Outputs = Deliverables

> "A product is an input or output, whether tangible or intangible, that can be described in advance, created and tested".

*Management Products* - Required and created to manage the project
*Specialist Products* - Created by the project to satisfy the business need

Benefits of Focus on products
- Ensures the project only undertakes work that directly contributes to the delivery of a product
- Helps manage uncontrolled change ny ensuring that all changes are reviewed before being accepted
- Reduces the risk of user complaints and disputes by establishing the deliverables at the start of the project.

> Product Descriptions are used to clearly define the product

7. Tailor to suit the project

# Themes (7)

Num | Theme | Description
------ | ------ | ------
1 | Business Case | Why are we doing the project?
2 | Organisation | Who is involved, what are their responsibilities?
3 | Quality | What are the quality requirements and how will they be judged?
4 | Plans | What, when and how much?
5 | Risk | What may or may not happen that may affect the projects objectives?
6 | Change | What impact does an issue have? How will it be dealt with?
7 | Progress | Where are we now? Where will we be?

## Plans (3) 

3 levels of plan are suggested:

1. Project Plan - Created during the Initiating a Project process
2. Stage Plans - Initiation stage plan, then subsequent stage plans
3. Team Plans

Exception Plans can be part of the Project or Stage plans.

> Without a plan there is no control

Plans provide stakeholders:

- What products need to be delivered
- The risks - Opportunities & threats
- Issues with the definition of the scope
- Which people, specialist equipment & resources are needed
- Are targets for time, cost, quality, scope, risk & benefits achievable (the 6 aspects of performance)

Plans need to contain:

- What has to be produced
- What has to be done to produce it
- What has to be done to produce it correctly
- When will it be produced
- How progress will be monitored 
- What has to be donâ€™t to control risks

### 7 Planning Steps

1. Designing a plan - Decide the number of stages, the format of the plan and the links to the programme or portfolio. 
2. Defining and analysing the products - Using the Product Based Planning technique (see Product Based Planning below)
3. Identifying activities and dependancies - Defining the work required (what we have to do) and their dependancies between them.
4. Preparing estimates - Duration of each activity
5. Preparing a schedule
6. Analysing risks to a plan (covering steps 2-5) - Consider risks to the plan and any mitigating actions should be included in the schedule.
7. Document the plan - What it contains, its constraint and monitoring an control arrangements etc.

### Plan Minimum Requirements

- Ensure the plans enable the Business Case to be realised.
- Have at least 2 Management Stages (Initiation Stage and rest of the Project)
- Produce a Project plan for the whole project and a Stage Plan for each Management Stage.
- Use the Product Based Planning technique for the Project, Stage and Exception plans, and optionally Team plans.
- Produce specific plans for managing exception
- Define the roles and responsibilities for planning
- Use lessons to inform planning
- Create and maintain the 4 Product Based Planning products (See Product Based Planning below)
- The Product Flow Diagram is also recommended, but optional.

### Project Plan

Created during the *Initiating a Project* process and is a *high-level* view of the full project, comprising of:

- Key milestones
- Resource requirements
- Overall cost estimates
- Overall time estimates

Defined as:

> A high-level plan showing the major products of the project, when they will be delivered and at what cost. An initial Project Plan is presented as part of the *project initiation documentation or PID*. This is revised as information on actual progress appears,  It is a major control documentation for the Project Board to measure actual progress against expectation.

The Project Plan provides a statement of how the below targets are to be achieved:

- Time
- Cost
- Scope
- Quality
- Identifies major control points, such as management stages and milestones.

And identifies the major products, activities and resources required for the project.

> The Project Plan is used within the Business Case and is used by the Project Board as a baseline to monitor progress stage-by-stage, and should align with Corporate/Programme Managements plan.

### Stage Plan (for each management stage)

*Initiation Stage Plan* is created in *Starting Up a project* and subsequent stage plans are created within *Managing a stage Boundary*.

A stage plan is required for each management stage and each stage plan is finalised near to the end of the previous stage. This provides more confidence as the stage plan is produced close to the time when the planned events will take place. Stage plans are performed with the benefit of hindsight of the performance of earlier stages and are much shorter in duration than the project plan.

Defined as:

> A detailed plan used as a basis for project management control throughout a management stage.

### Team Plan (optional)

Covers the work of the team during a stage and are *optional*.  A format is not prescribed for Team Plans as there may be more than one team on a project possibly from different organisations, with different internal plan processes.

Team Managers produce Team Plans in parallel with the production of a stage plan, or when a Work Package has been accepted during the Managing Product Delivery process.

### Exception Plan 

When predicted that a plan will no longer finish within the agreed tolerances and exception plan may be produced to replace that plan. The exception plan is prepared at the same level of detail as the plan it replaces, at either Project or Stage level. Once approved it becomes the new baselined project or stage plan.

Exception plans pick up from the current plans actuals and continues to the end of that plan.  Exception plans are not produced at Team level.

If a work package is forecast to exceed its tolerances, then provides it can be resolved within the stage tolerances, the Project Manager will amend or replace the work package in question.

Exception plans require approval from the *Project Board* to replace a *Stage Plan*, and *Corporate/Programme Management* to replace a *Project Plan*.

## Product Based Planning (use for all plans)

### 4 Products must be produces and maintained (in order)

1. Project Product Description
2. Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)
3. Product Description
4. Plan
5. *Recommended* Product Flow Diagram (Link between product based planning and activity based planning)

### Project Product Description
- Purpose of the product
- Products it consists of
- Customer quality expectations
- Acceptance Criteria
- Project level quality tolerance

### Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)
- Similar to the Work Breakdown Structure
- Used at Project and Stage Plan levels and optional for Team Plans.
- Top down hirearchle view of all the products a project is goin to generate
- Starting at top with the finished deliverable or outcome of the project
- Then breaking each product down to its constituent components in a hirearacle structure
- Before this can be done, a Project Product Description should be written
- The Senior User is responsible for specifying the Project Product
- But in practice the Project Manager will often complete the Project Product Description in conjunction with the Senior User and the Executive.
- This effectively provides a high-level scope of the project.

> Prince2 doesn not prescribe a format for a PBS, it could be a simple indented list, a mind-map or a digramtic structure. 

![PBS Example](https://github.com/NetDevNotes/prince2/blob/master/pbs-example.png)

### Product Description

- The aim of the Product Description is to provide enough detail so that the team members can build the products to the right standards. 
- They contain the Quality Specifications for the product
- And the Quality Methods by which these will be judged.

Headings | Description
-------- | ---------
Identifier | A unique key
Title | The name by which the product is known
Purpose | Why do we need this product
Composition | What will make up the product
Derivation | Where will the product come from
Format & Presentation | What form will it take
Development Skills Required | What skills will be required
Quality Criteria | What are the key quality factors
Quality Tolerance | Is the quality of the product acceptable
Quality Method | How will quality be judged
Quality Skills Required | Who is qualified to check the product
Quality Responsibilities | Who are the Producers, Reviewers & Approvers

### Product Flow Diagram

The Product Creation Sequence is depicted in the Product Flow Diagram which is used to show the order in which products must be created.

Product = Rectangle
External Product = Ellipse/Circle

Time flows in one direction, either from top to bottom or left to right.

# Risk (Theme)

"An uncertain event that, should it occur, will have an effect on the achievement of objectives.  It consists of a combination of the probability of a perceived threat or opportunity occurring, and the magnitude of its impact on objectives."

Threat = Risk with negative impact (Oil price soar!) 
Opportunity = Risk with positive impact (Oil price slump!)

Identified - Clearly describing the risks, so there is a common understanding.
Assessed - Ranking risks in terms of estimated probability, impact and timing or proximity.
Planned for - Identifying suitable answers to risks and assigning owners.
Controlled - By making sure the responses are implemented, monitored and controlled.

Risk Principles (9)

1. Understanding the project context
2. Involve the stakeholders
3. Establishing clear project objectives
4. Developing a project risk management approach (Defines the approach to identify, assess and control uncertainty).
5. Reporting on risks regularly
6. Defining clear roles and responsibilities.
7. Establishing a support structure and a supportive culture for risk management.
8. Monitoring for early warning indicators.
9. Establishing a review cycle and seek continued improvement.

### Minimum Requirements

1. Define the risk management approach which must cover:

- The way we identify and assess risks, implement responses and communicate risk.
- Assess whether the risks might affect the business justification.
- The roles and responsibilities.

2. We must maintain a risk register
3. Ensure risks are identified, assessed, managed and reviewed.
4. Use lessons learned to inform risk identification and management.

Products Required (2) 
> Both created during *Initiating a Project (IP)*
1. Risk Management Approach - How a risk will be managed (including any Processes, Procedures, Techniques and Responsibilities).
2. Risk Register - Provides a record of identified risks (Threats & Opportunities), their status and history. 

> Risk Tolerance - How much risk we are prepared to take. E.g. Month End might need all IT systems up, record this in the Risk Register and mitigate the risk.

> Risks identified in Starting Up a project (SU) needs to be logged in the PM's Daily Log and transferred to the Risk Register if the initiation stage is approved by the Project Board.

### Risk Register

Should contain:

- Risk Identifier - Unique reference (typically number/alpha-numeric value)
- Risk Author - Who raised the risk
- Date Registered - Date risk identified
- Risk Category - Describes the type of risk in terms of the projects chosen categories, schedule, quality, legal and so on..
- Risk Description - Describing the cause, the event, whether a threat or opportunity, and the likely effect which will describe the impact in words.
- Probability, impact and expected value of the risk - It is helpful to estimate the inherit values (pre-response action) and residual values (post-response value).
- Proximity - Describes how close to the present time is the risk event anticipated to happen, e.g. imminently, within this stage, within this project or beyond the project. This should be recorded within the projects chosen scales.
- Risk response categories - Will document how the project will treat the risk, in terms of the projects chosen categories, e.g. for both Threats and Opportunities, we can chose to:

  - Prepare a contingent plan (a plan for if the risk occurs)
  - Accept (make a conscious decision to live with the risk)
  - Share (choose to share the loss should a risk occur, usually through a contact)
  - Transfer the risk (to a 3rd party via a contract)
 - Threat - Avoid (plan the activities so the risk is avoided altogether, or there is no impact) & Reduce (take some action to reduce the probability or impact)
- Opportunity - Exploit (take action so the opportunity is realised) & Enhance (make it more likely to happen/increase the impact) 

> Tip: It might help to remember PASTAR & PASTEE

- Risk response - Will document any identified actions to resolve the risk and should be aligned to the chosen response categories. 

> More than one response may apply to a risk. 

- Risk status - Active or Closed?
- Risk owner - Person responsible for managing the risk, there can be only one owner per risk.
- Risk actionee - Person(s) who will implement the actions described int he risk response. And may or may not be the same person as the Risk Owner.

## Risk Management Procedure

1. Identify - Identify the context and risks (examining the Risk mgmt approach, project mandate, project brief, Project product description). Record risks in the Risk Register. Techniques to identify risks could be Review Lessons, Risk Checklists, Risk Prompt Lists, Brainstorming, Risk Breakdown Structures).
2. Assess - Estimate and Evaluate.  Once identified, risks should be assessed in terms of their, Probability (how likely to happen?), Impact (what will happen if it does?), Proximity (when will it happen?). 
3. Plan - Risk Responses (see above: Prepare Contingent Plan, Accept, Share, Transfer, Avoid, Reduce, Exploit, Enhance) - PASTAR/PASTEE
4. Implement - Put the chosen Risk Response(s) into action.  Clear responsibilities need to be identified for the Risk Owner (management, monitor, control a particular risk assigned to them), this includes the implementation of the selected responses to address the threat or maximise the opportunities. The Risk Actionee who is assigned to carry out a particular risk action(s) and takes direction from the Risk Owner. 
5. Communicate - Carried out in parallel with the other steps. Information about risks is communicated as part of the following reports:

- Checkpoint reports
- Highlight reports
- End stage reports
- End project reports
- Exception reports

> The funding for risk mitigation actions needs to be considered, the money set aside for these activities is known as the Risk Budget, and forms part of the Project Budget. The more spent on managing risk, the less for other project activities. Risks need to be analysed to avoid spending too much on low priority risks, and not enough on high priority risks.

> Risk needs to be expresses in terms of its, Cause (the situation), Event (the threat), Effect (the result).

# Quality (Theme)

### Quality 
"The degree to which a set of inherent characteristics of a product, service, process, person, organisation, system or resource fulfils requirements"

### Quality Management
"The coordinated activities to direct and control an organisation with regard to quality" 

The main aim of quality management is to ensure the products meet business expectations, and enable the desired benefits to be realised.

### Focus on Products (Principle)

Central to quality and we need to ensure we:
  - Agree the customer's quality expectations and acceptance criteria for the project product
  - Identify the project's products
  - Define the products in product descriptions (including the quality criteria, quality methods and the quality responsibilities)
  - Implement and track the quality methods used throughout the project

### Customer Quality Expectations (CQE)
"A statement about the quality expected from the project product, captures in the **Project Product Description**"

Discussed and agreed with the customer in Starting up a project (SU) and should cover:
- Key quality requirements (for the projects product)
- Standards and processes (that should be applied)
- Quality Management System Usage (How it will be used)
- Assessment measurements (any measurement that may be useful in assessing whether the projects product meets the expectations

> CQE are often expressed in broad terms at first, but as far as possible should be expanded into a measurable format and prioritised.

The below people should have a shared understanding of these expectations:
- Senior User
- Senior Supplier
- Project Manager

Once the CQE has been established the **Acceptance Criteria** should be developed :point_right:

### Acceptance Criteria (fit for purpose?)

"A prioritised list of criteria that the project product must meet before the customer will accept it.  I.e. measurable definitions of the attributes required for the set of products to be acceptable to key stakeholders"

> We can't always have it all, so the Acceptance Criteria needs to be prioritised which will help set the **Quality Tolerances**

- Both CQE and Acceptance Criteria may develop over time as more is known about the solution.
- Once finalised, any change must pass through the **Change Control process**

### Quality Planning

- Define the project's products
- Define the quality criteria
- Define the quality method (the way we check the product meets it criteria)
- Define the quality responsibilities of those involved

The purpose of planning is to provide a secure basis for:
- Project board agree to the expectations / acceptance criteria and the means on how it will be judged.
- Communicating agreements with the stakeholders (for a common understanding on what the project is setting out to achieve)
- Baseline the projects quality controls and tolerances (to ensure we provide products that are fit for purpose)

### Quality Control

- Ensures products are fit for purpose
- What we produce meets its quality criteria 
- The results of quality checks are recorded in the Quality Register

Quality control involves: 
- Checking products meet their quality criteria (by testing, review and inspections)
- Illimanate poor performance by implementing lessons learned in previous stages or projects.

### Quality Assurance vs Project Assurance 

Quality Assurance is NOT Project Assurance:

Quality Assurance | Project Assurance
----------------- | -----------------
Check project is managed / directed correctly | Project Board Responsibility
In line with corporate, programme, customer standards and policies | Each board member has their own set of responsibilities
Independent of the project | NOT independent of the project 
. | Cannot be delegated to the Project Manager, Project Support or Team Manager

### Minimum Requirements

- The project should define its Quality Management Approach (Initiating a Project) covering as a minimum:
  - The approach to quality control
  - The approach to project assurance
  - The way quality will be communicated through the life cycle
  - The roles and responsibilities of those involved
  
- Ensure the quality criteria for the products are specified in the product descriptions
- Maintain quality records
- Specify customer's quality expectations and acceptance criteria
- Use lessons to inform planning (including defining quality criteria and expectations)

Two products at minimum need to be produced and maintained:

1. Quality Management Approach - describes how quality will be managed, including:
- Processes
- Procedures
- Techniques
- Standards
- Quality Register
- Responsibilities

The Quality Management Approach describes:
- Any Quality Management Systems in the Customer/Supplier environment will be applied
- Along with any applicable Standards
- Approach to Project Assurance
- Any Tailoring (that may be required)

2. Quality Register
- Provides information for the end stage and end project reports
- Summarise all the quality activities
- Provides a unique reference for each quality activity
- Act as a pointer for quality records
- Summarises the number and type of activities undertaken
- Provides an Audit Trail of quality events planned and undertaken

### Quality Planning and Control

Quality Planning
- Objectives & requirements
- Overall approach (in the Quality Mgmt Approach, during the Initiation stage)
- Stage quality activities (ensuring quality is acheived)

Customer Quality Expections
- Docuyment in the Project Product Description
- Project Initiation documentation

Qualty Control (the means of ensuring that products meet the quality criteria specified for them)

> Quality Control is about examining products to determine that they meet requirements, and normally takes place after some wokrk has been done.

- Objectives & Requirements
- Overall approach
  - Quality mgmt approach (which is part of the Project Initiation documentation, created during the Initiation stage)

Quality Methods
In-Process (where specialists methods are used in the creation of the products and on-going quality inspections)
Appraisal (where the finished products are assessed for compelteness, testing is carreid out where the Quality Criteria are objective and measureable.  Quality Inspection methods are used when some subjective judgement is required.

> The Quality Review Technique is suggested by Prince2 which compliments the use of Product Descriptions. 

### Quality Reviews
- Check a completed product for errors
- Can be envoked at any point within a project
- Carried out in the **Managing Product Delivery** process as the product is compelted
- Any product can be the subject of a review
- Quality Management Approach
- Product Descriptions (includes the Quality Criteria used by reviewers to make sure the quality standards have been met)
- Quality Register

Benefits
- A structured and organised approach to the examination of subjective quality criteria (found in the Product Desctiption)
- The early identification of defects.

Objectives
- Assess the conformity of a product (criteria found in the Product Desctiption)
- Provide wider acceptance (involve key intersted parites in checking the products quality 
- Confirm the product is complete and ready for approval
- Baseline the product for Change Control

### Quality Review Procedure/Technique

1. Review preparation
2. Review agenda
3. Review follow-up

1. Review preparation
- Time and location of meeting (where and when)
- Who will attend
- Distribute copy of product
- Assess the product against quality criteria
- Prepare a Question List for the Producer

2. Review agenda
- Discussion and clarification of any major errors
- Agreement on appropriate actions
- Agreement on the outcome of Quality Review
- Sign-off of the product (if appropriate)
- Document Actions & Responsibilities

Results
- Compelte (product is fit for purpose)
- Conditionally Complete (Fit for purpose subject to the actions being completed 
- Incomplete (the product requires another review cycle)

3. Review follow-up
- Completing actions
- Communicating results (to management)
- Storing/filing records produced durin the review
- Once the Quality Review is compelte, the product is Approved by the appropriate management person or group.

### Quality Review Roles 
Chair - Conducts review and **checks the product is ready for review**
Presenter - Introduces the product to the reviewers and represents the Producers of the product.
Reviewer - Reviews the product and **checks it against its quality criteria**
Administrator - Administrative suport to the Chair, records results and recommends actions.

The above are roles not people, as such the minimum number of people who can carry out a review is 2
- One taking the Chair and Reviewer roles
- The other the Presenter and Administator roles

# Change (Theme)

Issue & Change Control
- Identification
- Assessment
- Control
