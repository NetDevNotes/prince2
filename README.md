# Project Performance

## 6 aspects of project performance to be managed

1. Scope (everything needed to buy/build and all the work involved in doing it.  Also include what is out of scope to set stakeholders expectations.
2. Quality (defines the standards which the delivered scope must meet to be fit for purpose)
3. Risk (things might not go to plan, positive or negative, threats or opportunities) 
4. Cost (Project budget)
6. Time (Duration of the project)
6. Benefits (Measurable improvement in BAU because of the project)

# A Project

Prince2 assumes there will be a Customer who specifies the desired results and a Supplier who provides resources and skills to deliver these results.

> Customer Supplier Environment

The organisation that commissions a project is *Corporate*, *Programme Mgmt* or the *Customer*.  They are also responsible for governance and realising the projects benefits.

A project can be standalone or part of a programme (and as such subject to the programmes governance, structure & reporting requirements).

> "A programme is a group of related projects which deliver outcomes and benefits related to the organisations strategy"

> "A project can be part of a portfollio of strategic objectives"

# Principles 

1. Continued business justification (Business Case)
2. Learn from experience (learn from previous projects or previous management stages)
3. Defined roles and responsibilities (Stakeholders - Business Sponsors, Users, Suppliers (int/ext))
4. Manage by stages (discreet sequential stages)
> "The section of the project the Project Manager is managing on behalf of the Project Board at any one time, at the end of which the Project Board will wish to review progress to date, the state of the project plan, the business case and risks, and the next stage plan, in order to decide whether to continue the project"
5. Manage by exception
6. Focus on products
7. Tailor to suit the project

# Themes

## Plans (Theme)

Project Plan
Stage Plan
Team Plan
+
Exception Plan

## Project Plan (for the whole of the project)

A high-level view of the full project, comprising of key milestones, resource requirements and overall cost and time estimates.

Defined as:

> A high-level plan showing the major products of the project, when they will be delivered and at what cost. An initial Project Plan is presented as part of the project initiation documentation or PID. This is revised as information on actual progress appears,  It is a major control documentation for the Project Board to measure actual progress against expectation.

Plans provide stakeholders:

- What products need to be delivered
- The risks - Opportunities & threats
- Issues with the definition of the scope
- Which people, specialist equipment & resources are needed
- Are targets for time, cost, quality, scope, risk & benefits achievable (the 6 aspects of performance)

## Stage Plan (for each management stage)

Defined as:

> A detailed plan used as a basis for project management control throughout a management stage.

## Team Plan (optional)

Covers the work of the team during a stage and are optional.

Plans need to contain:

- What has to be produced
- What has to be done to produce it
- What has to be done to produce it correctly
- When will it be produced
- How progress will be monitored 
- What has to be donâ€™t to control risks

## Exception Plan


# Management Stages

### 2 minimum stages

- Initiation (thinking)
- Rest of the project (doing)

You could align management stages with delivery stages, such as design, build and test.

Delivery stages may overlap each other (build and training may overlap somewhat, but management stages are always sequential (mgmt-stg-1, 2, 4)). 

Typically you can break up the delivery stage that crosses management stage boundaries into smaller chunks (training syllabus in mgmt-1, training staff in mgmt-2).

## Product Based Planning (use for all plans)

### 4 Products must be produces and maintained (in Order)

1. Project Product Description
2. Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)
3. Product Description
4. Plan
5. *Recommended* Product Flow Diagram (Link between product based planning and activity based planning)

### Project Product Description

### Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)

### Product Description

Headings | Description
-------- | ---------
Identifier | A unique key
Title | The name by which the product is known
Purpose | Why do we need this product
Composition | What will make up the product
Derivation | Where will the product come from
Format & Presentation | What form will it take
Development Skills Required | What skills will be required
Quality Criteria | What are the key quality factors
Quality Tolerance | Is the quality of the product acceptable
Quality Method | How will quality be judged
Quality Skills Required | Who is qualified to check the product
Quality Responsibilities | Who are the Producers, Reviewers & Approvers

### Product Flow Diagram

The Product Creation Sequence is depicted in the Product Flow Diagram which is used to show the order in which products must be created.

Product = Rectangle
External Product = Ellipse/Circle

Time flows in one direction, either from top to bottom or left to right.
