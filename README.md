Prince 2 Project Management Notes

## Project Performance

### 6 aspects of project performance to be managed

- Time (Duration of the project)
- Cost (Project budget)
- Quality (defines the standards which the delivered scope must meet to be fit for purpose)
- Scope (everything needed to buy/build and all the work involved in doing it.  Also what is out of scope to set stakeholders expectations. 
- Risk (things not going to plan, positive or negative, threats or opportunities) 
- Benefits (Measurable improvement in BAU because of the project)

## Themes

Team Plan

## Project Plan

A high-level view of the full project, comprosing of key milestones, resource requirements and overall cost and time estimates.

Defined as:

> A high-level plan showing the major products of the project, when they will be delivered and at what cost. An initial Project Plan is presented as part of the project initiation documentation or PID. This is revised as information on actual progress appears,  It is a major control documentation for the Project Board to measure actual progress against expectation.

Plans provide stakeholders:

- What products need to be delivered
- The risks - Opportunities & threats
- Issues with the definition of the scope
- Which people, specialist equipment & resources are needed
- Are targets for time, cost, quality, scope, risk & benefits achievable (the 6 aspects of performance)

Plans need to contain:

- What has to be produced
- What has to be done to produce it
- What has to be done to produce it correctly
- When will it be produced
- How progress will be monitored 
- What has to be donâ€™t to control risks
