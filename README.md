# Prince2 :crown:
Prince2 Foundation Notes

- Principles (7)
- Themes (7) 
- Proceses (7)

# A Project Defined

Prince2 assumes there will be a Customer who specifies the desired results and a Supplier who provides resources and skills to deliver these results.

> Customer Supplier Environment

The organisation that commissions a project is *Corporate*, *Programme Mgmt* or the *Customer*.  They are also responsible for governance and realising the projects benefits.

A project can be standalone or part of a programme (and as such subject to the programmes governance, structure & reporting requirements).

> "A programme is a group of related projects which deliver outcomes and benefits related to the organisations strategy"

> "A project can be part of a portfolio of strategic objectives"

# Project Performance (6)

## 6 aspects of project performance to be managed

1. Scope (everything needed to buy/build and all the work involved in doing it.  Also include what is out of scope to set stakeholders expectations.
2. Quality (defines the standards which the delivered scope must meet to be fit for purpose)
3. Risk (things might not go to plan, positive or negative, threats or opportunities) 
4. Cost (Project budget)
6. Time (Duration of the project)
6. Benefits (Measurable improvement in BAU because of the project)

# Principles (7) 

1. Continued business justification
2. Learn from experience
3. Defined roles and responsibilities 
4. Manage by stages 
5. Manage by exception
6. Focus on products 
7. Tailor to suit the project

### More detail

1. Continued business justification (Business Case)
2. Learn from experience (learn from previous projects or previous management stages)
3. Defined roles and responsibilities (Stakeholders - Business Sponsors, Users, Suppliers (int/ext))
4. Manage by stages (discreet sequential stages, do a little work, review, do a little more, review and so on until completion.)

> "The section of the project the Project Manager is managing on behalf of the Project Board at any one time, at the end of which the Project Board will wish to review progress to date, the state of the project plan, the business case and risks, and the next stage plan, in order to decide whether to continue the project"

## Management Stages (2 minimum)

- Initiation (thinking)
- Rest of the project (doing)

Management stages could be aligned with delivery stages, such as design, build and test.

Delivery stages may overlap each other, i.e. build and training may overlap somewhat, but management stages are always sequential (mgmt-stg-1, mgmt-stg-2, mgmt-stg-3, mgmt-stg-4). 

Typically you can break up the delivery stage that crosses management stage boundaries into smaller chunks (training syllabus in mgmt-stg-1, training staff in mgmt-stg-2).

The number of stages will depend on the size and complexity of the project, the risk, organisational standard and policies and where significant decisions are needed usually before a major commitment is made, such as *awarding a contract*.

Smaller stages offer more control to the project board who are the key decision makers, but also required more effort on their part.

Benefits of Managing by Stages
- Making sure the project is properly initiated before work starts
- Giving the Project Board the opportunity to assess the projects viability at defined intervals
- Making sure key decisions are made before the work starts (such as awarding contracts)
- Clarifying the impact of external influences on the project before the go-ahead is given
- Delegating authority to the Project Manager on a stage by stage basis - *Management by Exception*

5. Manage by exception (Tolerances are set for each aspect of performance, Cost, Time, Scope, Quality, Risk, Benefits. If within tolerances o need to meet.  Immediately escalate when forecast is expected to exceed a tolerance).
6. Focus on products (focus on definition, delivery and quality requirements of products)

> Products = Outputs = Deliverables

> "A product is an input or output, whether tangible or intangible, that can be described in advance, created and tested".

*Management Products* - Required and created to manage the project
*Specialist Products* - Created by the project to satisfy the business need

Benefits of Focus on products
- Ensures the project only undertakes work that directly contributes to the delivery of a product
- Helps manage uncontrolled change ny ensuring that all changes are reviewed before being accepted
- Reduces the risk of user complaints and disputes by establishing the deliverables at the start of the project.

> Product Descriptions are used to clearly define the product

7. Tailor to suit the project

# Themes (7)

Num | Theme | Description
------ | ------ | ------
1 | Business Case | Why are we doing the project?
2 | Organisation | Who is involved, what are their responsibilities?
3 | Quality | What are the quality requirements and how will they be judged?
4 | Plans | What, when and how much?
5 | Risk | What may or may not happen that may affect the projects objectives?
6 | Change | What impact does an issue have? How will it be dealt with?
7 | Progress | Where are we now? Where will we be?

## Plans (3) 

3 levels of plan are suggested:

1. Project Plan - Created during the Initiating a Project process
2. Stage Plans - Initiation stage plan, then subsequent stage plans
3. Team Plans

Exception Plans can be part of the Project or Stage plans.

> Without a plan there is no control

Plans provide stakeholders:

- What products need to be delivered
- The risks - Opportunities & threats
- Issues with the definition of the scope
- Which people, specialist equipment & resources are needed
- Are targets for time, cost, quality, scope, risk & benefits achievable (the 6 aspects of performance)

Plans need to contain:

- What has to be produced
- What has to be done to produce it
- What has to be done to produce it correctly
- When will it be produced
- How progress will be monitored 
- What has to be donâ€™t to control risks

### 7 Planning Steps

1. Designing a plan - Decide the number of stages, the format of the plan and the links to the programme or portfolio. 
2. Defining and analysing the products - Using the Product Based Planning technique (see Product Based Planning below)
3. Identifying activities and dependancies - Defining the work required (what we have to do) and their dependancies between them.
4. Preparing estimates - Duration of each activity
5. Preparing a schedule
6. Analysing risks to a plan (covering steps 2-5) - Consider risks to the plan and any mitigating actions should be included in the schedule.
7. Document the plan - What it contains, its constraint and monitoring an control arrangements etc.

### Plan Minimum Requirements

- Ensure the plans enable the Business Case to be realised.
- Have at least 2 Management Stages (Initiation Stage and rest of the Project)
- Produce a Project plan for the whole project and a Stage Plan for each Management Stage.
- Use the Product Based Planning technique for the Project, Stage and Exception plans, and optionally Team plans.
- Produce specific plans for managing exception
- Define the roles and responsibilities for planning
- Use lessons to inform planning
- Create and maintain the 4 Product Based Planning products (See Product Based Planning below)
- The Product Flow Diagram is also recommended, but optional.

### Project Plan

Created during the *Initiating a Project* process and is a *high-level* view of the full project, comprising of:

- Key milestones
- Resource requirements
- Overall cost estimates
- Overall time estimates

Defined as:

> A high-level plan showing the major products of the project, when they will be delivered and at what cost. An initial Project Plan is presented as part of the *project initiation documentation or PID*. This is revised as information on actual progress appears,  It is a major control documentation for the Project Board to measure actual progress against expectation.

The Project Plan provides a statement of how the below targets are to be achieved:

- Time
- Cost
- Scope
- Quality
- Identifies major control points, such as management stages and milestones.

And identifies the major products, activities and resources required for the project.

> The Project Plan is used within the Business Case and is used by the Project Board as a baseline to monitor progress stage-by-stage, and should align with Corporate/Programme Managements plan.

### Stage Plan (for each management stage)

*Initiation Stage Plan* is created in *Starting Up a project* and subsequent stage plans are created within *Managing a stage Boundary*.

A stage plan is required for each management stage and each stage plan is finalised near to the end of the previous stage. This provides more confidence as the stage plan is produced close to the time when the planned events will take place. Stage plans are performed with the benefit of hindsight of the performance of earlier stages and are much shorter in duration than the project plan.

Defined as:

> A detailed plan used as a basis for project management control throughout a management stage.

### Team Plan (optional)

Covers the work of the team during a stage and are *optional*.  A format is not prescribed for Team Plans as there may be more than one team on a project possibly from different organisations, with different internal plan processes.

Team Managers produce Team Plans in parallel with the production of a stage plan, or when a Work Package has been accepted during the Managing Product Delivery process.

### Exception Plan 

When predicted that a plan will no longer finish within the agreed tolerances and exception plan may be produced to replace that plan. The exception plan is prepared at the same level of detail as the plan it replaces, at either Project or Stage level. Once approved it becomes the new baselined project or stage plan.

Exception plans pick up from the current plans actuals and continues to the end of that plan.  Exception plans are not produced at Team level.

If a work package is forecast to exceed its tolerances, then provides it can be resolved within the stage tolerances, the Project Manager will amend or replace the work package in question.

Exception plans require approval from the *Project Board* to replace a *Stage Plan*, and *Corporate/Programme Management* to replace a *Project Plan*.

## Product Based Planning (use for all plans)

### 4 Products must be produces and maintained (in order)

1. Project Product Description
2. Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)
3. Product Description
4. Plan
5. *Recommended* Product Flow Diagram (Link between product based planning and activity based planning)

### Project Product Description
- Purpose of the product
- Products it consists of
- Customer quality expectations
- Acceptance Criteria
- Project level quality tolerance

### Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)
- Similar to the Work Breakdown Structure
- Used at Project and Stage Plan levels and optional for Team Plans.
- Top down hirearchle view of all the products a project is goin to generate
- Starting at top with the finished deliverable or outcome of the project
- Then breaking each product down to its constituent components in a hirearacle structure
- Before this can be done, a Project Product Description should be written
- The Senior User is responsible for specifying the Project Product
- But in practice the Project Manager will often complete the Project Product Description in conjunction with the Senior User and the Executive.
- This effectively provides a high-level scope of the project.

> Prince2 doesn not prescribe a format for a PBS, it could be a simple indented list, a mind-map or a digramtic structure. 

![PBS Example](https://github.com/NetDevNotes/prince2/blob/master/pbs-example.png)

### Product Description

- The aim of the Product Description is to provide enough detail so that the team members can build the products to the right standards. 
- They contain the Quality Specifications for the product
- And the Quality Methods by which these will be judged.

Headings | Description
-------- | ---------
Identifier | A unique key
Title | The name by which the product is known
Purpose | Why do we need this product
Composition | What will make up the product
Derivation | Where will the product come from
Format & Presentation | What form will it take
Development Skills Required | What skills will be required
Quality Criteria | What are the key quality factors
Quality Tolerance | Is the quality of the product acceptable
Quality Method | How will quality be judged
Quality Skills Required | Who is qualified to check the product
Quality Responsibilities | Who are the Producers, Reviewers & Approvers

### Product Flow Diagram

The Product Creation Sequence is depicted in the Product Flow Diagram which is used to show the order in which products must be created.

Product = Rectangle
External Product = Ellipse/Circle

Time flows in one direction, either from top to bottom or left to right.

# Risk (Theme)

"An uncertain event that, should it occur, will have an effect on the achievement of objectives.  It consists of a combination of the probability of a perceived threat or opportunity occurring, and the magnitude of its impact on objectives."

Threat = Risk with negative impact (Oil price soar!) 
Opportunity = Risk with positive impact (Oil price slump!)

Identified - Clearly describing the risks, so there is a common understanding.
Assessed - Ranking risks in terms of estimated probability, impact and timing or proximity.
Planned for - Identifying suitable answers to risks and assigning owners.
Controlled - By making sure the responses are implemented, monitored and controlled.

Risk Principles (9)

1. Understanding the project context
2. Involve the stakeholders
3. Establishing clear project objectives
4. Developing a project risk management approach (Defines the approach to identify, assess and control uncertainty).
5. Reporting on risks regularly
6. Defining clear roles and responsibilities.
7. Establishing a support structure and a supportive culture for risk management.
8. Monitoring for early warning indicators.
9. Establishing a review cycle and seek continued improvement.

### Minimum Requirements

1. Define the risk management approach which must cover:

- The way we identify and assess risks, implement responses and communicate risk.
- Assess whether the risks might affect the business justification.
- The roles and responsibilities.

2. We must maintain a risk register
3. Ensure risks are identified, assessed, managed and reviewed.
4. Use lessons learned to inform risk identification and management.

Products Required (2) 
> Both created during *Initiating a Project (IP)*
1. Risk Management Approach - How a risk will be managed (including any Processes, Procedures, Techniques and Responsibilities).
2. Risk Register - Provides a record of identified risks (Threats & Opportunities), their status and history. 

> Risk Tolerance - How much risk we are prepared to take. E.g. Month End might need all IT systems up, record this in the Risk Register and mitigate the risk.

> Risks identified in Starting Up a project (SU) needs to be logged in the PM's Daily Log and transferred to the Risk Register if the initiation stage is approved by the Project Board.

### Risk Register

Should contain:

- Risk Identifier - Unique reference (typically number/alpha-numeric value)
- Risk Author - Who raised the risk
- Date Registered - Date risk identified
- Risk Category - Describes the type of risk in terms of the projects chosen categories, schedule, quality, legal and so on..
- Risk Description - Describing the cause, the event, whether a threat or opportunity, and the likely effect which will describe the impact in words.
- Probability, impact and expected value of the risk - It is helpful to estimate the inherit values (pre-response action) and residual values (post-response value).
- Proximity - Describes how close to the present time is the risk event anticipated to happen, e.g. imminently, within this stage, within this project or beyond the project. This should be recorded within the projects chosen scales.
- Risk response categories - Will document how the project will treat the risk, in terms of the projects chosen categories, e.g. for both Threats and Opportunities, we can chose to:

  - Prepare a contingent plan (a plan for if the risk occurs)
  - Accept (make a conscious decision to live with the risk)
  - Share (choose to share the loss should a risk occur, usually through a contact)
  - Transfer the risk (to a 3rd party via a contract)
 - Threat - Avoid (plan the activities so the risk is avoided altogether, or there is no impact) & Reduce (take some action to reduce the probability or impact)
- Opportunity - Exploit (take action so the opportunity is realised) & Enhance (make it more likely to happen/increase the impact) 

> Tip: It might help to remember PASTAR & PASTEE

- Risk response - Will document any identified actions to resolve the risk and should be aligned to the chosen response categories. 

> More than one response may apply to a risk. 

- Risk status - Active or Closed?
- Risk owner - Person responsible for managing the risk, there can be only one owner per risk.
- Risk actionee - Person(s) who will implement the actions described int he risk response. And may or may not be the same person as the Risk Owner.

## Risk Management Procedure

1. Identify - Identify the context and risks (examining the Risk mgmt approach, project mandate, project brief, Project product description). Record risks in the Risk Register. Techniques to identify risks could be Review Lessons, Risk Checklists, Risk Prompt Lists, Brainstorming, Risk Breakdown Structures).
2. Assess - Estimate and Evaluate.  Once identified, risks should be assessed in terms of their, Probability (how likely to happen?), Impact (what will happen if it does?), Proximity (when will it happen?). 
3. Plan - Risk Responses (see above: Prepare Contingent Plan, Accept, Share, Transfer, Avoid, Reduce, Exploit, Enhance) - PASTAR/PASTEE
4. Implement - Put the chosen Risk Response(s) into action.  Clear responsibilities need to be identified for the Risk Owner (management, monitor, control a particular risk assigned to them), this includes the implementation of the selected responses to address the threat or maximise the opportunities. The Risk Actionee who is assigned to carry out a particular risk action(s) and takes direction from the Risk Owner. 
5. Communicate - Carried out in parallel with the other steps. Information about risks is communicated as part of the following reports:

- Checkpoint reports
- Highlight reports
- End stage reports
- End project reports
- Exception reports

> The funding for risk mitigation actions needs to be considered, the money set aside for these activities is known as the Risk Budget, and forms part of the Project Budget. The more spent on managing risk, the less for other project activities. Risks need to be analysed to avoid spending too much on low priority risks, and not enough on high priority risks.

> Risk needs to be expresses in terms of its, Cause (the situation), Event (the threat), Effect (the result).

### Risk Responsibilities

Corportate or Program Management | Executive | Senior User | Senior Supplier | Project Manager | Team Manager | Project Assurance | Project Support
-------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |

# Quality (Theme)

### Quality 
"The degree to which a set of inherent characteristics of a product, service, process, person, organisation, system or resource fulfils requirements"

### Quality Management
"The coordinated activities to direct and control an organisation with regard to quality" 

The main aim of quality management is to ensure the products meet business expectations, and enable the desired benefits to be realised.

### Focus on Products (Principle)

Central to quality and we need to ensure we:
  - Agree the customer's quality expectations and acceptance criteria for the project product
  - Identify the project's products
  - Define the products in product descriptions (including the quality criteria, quality methods and the quality responsibilities)
  - Implement and track the quality methods used throughout the project

### Customer Quality Expectations (CQE)
"A statement about the quality expected from the project product, captures in the **Project Product Description**"

Discussed and agreed with the customer in Starting up a project (SU) and should cover:
- Key quality requirements (for the projects product)
- Standards and processes (that should be applied)
- Quality Management System Usage (How it will be used)
- Assessment measurements (any measurement that may be useful in assessing whether the projects product meets the expectations

> CQE are often expressed in broad terms at first, but as far as possible should be expanded into a measurable format and prioritised.

The below people should have a shared understanding of these expectations:
- Senior User
- Senior Supplier
- Project Manager

Once the CQE has been established the **Acceptance Criteria** should be developed :point_right:

### Acceptance Criteria (fit for purpose?)

"A prioritised list of criteria that the project product must meet before the customer will accept it.  I.e. measurable definitions of the attributes required for the set of products to be acceptable to key stakeholders"

> We can't always have it all, so the Acceptance Criteria needs to be prioritised which will help set the **Quality Tolerances**

- Both CQE and Acceptance Criteria may develop over time as more is known about the solution.
- Once finalised, any change must pass through the **Change Control process**

### Quality Planning

- Define the project's products
- Define the quality criteria
- Define the quality method (the way we check the product meets it criteria)
- Define the quality responsibilities of those involved

The purpose of planning is to provide a secure basis for:
- Project board agree to the expectations / acceptance criteria and the means on how it will be judged.
- Communicating agreements with the stakeholders (for a common understanding on what the project is setting out to achieve)
- Baseline the projects quality controls and tolerances (to ensure we provide products that are fit for purpose)

### Quality Control

- Ensures products are fit for purpose
- What we produce meets its quality criteria 
- The results of quality checks are recorded in the Quality Register

Quality control involves: 
- Checking products meet their quality criteria (by testing, review and inspections)
- Illimanate poor performance by implementing lessons learned in previous stages or projects.

### Quality Assurance vs Project Assurance 

Quality Assurance is NOT Project Assurance:

Quality Assurance | Project Assurance
----------------- | -----------------
Check project is managed / directed correctly | Project Board Responsibility
In line with corporate, programme, customer standards and policies | Each board member has their own set of responsibilities
Independent of the project | NOT independent of the project 
. | Cannot be delegated to the Project Manager, Project Support or Team Manager

### Minimum Requirements

- The project should define its Quality Management Approach (Initiating a Project) covering as a minimum:
  - The approach to quality control
  - The approach to project assurance
  - The way quality will be communicated through the life cycle
  - The roles and responsibilities of those involved
  
- Ensure the quality criteria for the products are specified in the product descriptions
- Maintain quality records
- Specify customer's quality expectations and acceptance criteria
- Use lessons to inform planning (including defining quality criteria and expectations)

Two products at minimum need to be produced and maintained:

1. Quality Management Approach - describes how quality will be managed, including:
- Processes
- Procedures
- Techniques
- Standards
- Quality Register
- Responsibilities

The Quality Management Approach describes:
- Any Quality Management Systems in the Customer/Supplier environment will be applied
- Along with any applicable Standards
- Approach to Project Assurance
- Any Tailoring (that may be required)

2. Quality Register
- Provides information for the end stage and end project reports
- Summarise all the quality activities
- Provides a unique reference for each quality activity
- Act as a pointer for quality records
- Summarises the number and type of activities undertaken
- Provides an Audit Trail of quality events planned and undertaken

### Quality Planning and Control

Quality Planning
- Objectives & requirements
- Overall approach (in the Quality Mgmt Approach, during the Initiation stage)
- Stage quality activities (ensuring quality is acheived)

Customer Quality Expections
- Docuyment in the Project Product Description
- Project Initiation documentation

Qualty Control (the means of ensuring that products meet the quality criteria specified for them)

> Quality Control is about examining products to determine that they meet requirements, and normally takes place after some wokrk has been done.

- Objectives & Requirements
- Overall approach
  - Quality mgmt approach (which is part of the Project Initiation documentation, created during the Initiation stage)

Quality Methods
In-Process (where specialists methods are used in the creation of the products and on-going quality inspections)
Appraisal (where the finished products are assessed for compelteness, testing is carreid out where the Quality Criteria are objective and measureable.  Quality Inspection methods are used when some subjective judgement is required.

> The Quality Review Technique is suggested by Prince2 which compliments the use of Product Descriptions. 

### Quality Reviews
- Check a completed product for errors
- Can be envoked at any point within a project
- Carried out in the **Managing Product Delivery** process as the product is compelted
- Any product can be the subject of a review
- Quality Management Approach
- Product Descriptions (includes the Quality Criteria used by reviewers to make sure the quality standards have been met)
- Quality Register

Benefits
- A structured and organised approach to the examination of subjective quality criteria (found in the Product Desctiption)
- The early identification of defects.

Objectives
- Assess the conformity of a product (criteria found in the Product Desctiption)
- Provide wider acceptance (involve key intersted parites in checking the products quality 
- Confirm the product is complete and ready for approval
- Baseline the product for Change Control

### Quality Review Procedure/Technique

1. Review preparation
2. Review agenda
3. Review follow-up

1. Review preparation
- Time and location of meeting (where and when)
- Who will attend
- Distribute copy of product
- Assess the product against quality criteria
- Prepare a Question List for the Producer

2. Review agenda
- Discussion and clarification of any major errors
- Agreement on appropriate actions
- Agreement on the outcome of Quality Review
- Sign-off of the product (if appropriate)
- Document Actions & Responsibilities

Results
- Compelte (product is fit for purpose)
- Conditionally Complete (Fit for purpose subject to the actions being completed 
- Incomplete (the product requires another review cycle)

3. Review follow-up
- Completing actions
- Communicating results (to management)
- Storing/filing records produced durin the review
- Once the Quality Review is compelte, the product is Approved by the appropriate management person or group.

### Quality Review Roles 
Chair - Conducts review and **checks the product is ready for review**
Presenter - Introduces the product to the reviewers and represents the Producers of the product.
Reviewer - Reviews the product and **checks it against its quality criteria**
Administrator - Administrative suport to the Chair, records results and recommends actions.

The above are roles not people, as such the minimum number of people who can carry out a review is 2
- One taking the Chair and Reviewer roles
- The other the Presenter and Administator roles

# Change (Theme)

Purpose
"Identify, assess and control any potential and approved changes to the project baselines"

Issue & Change Control =
- Identification
- Assessment
- Control

### Baseline 
"Reference levels against which an entity is monitored and controlled"

### Issue
"Anything happening during the project which, unless resolved, will result in a change to a baseline product, plan or performance target (inc. time, cost, scope, quality, risk and benefits).

3 Types of Issues which may arise:
- Request for Change (A proposal to change a baseline).
- Off specification (Something that should be provided, but is currently not being provided or is forecast not to be provided).
- Problem or concern (Any other matter that requires the PM to either resolve or escalate to the Project Board 
for a decision or action).

### Approach to Change

Procedures for:
- Change Control
- Issues management
- Records
- Timing of activities
- Assessment scales

### Products used as part of Change Control process

Change Control Approach
- Created during Initiating a Project
- Kept be under review
- And if necessary refined and updated by the Managing a Stage Boundary process
- Will document the procedure for Change Control & Issue management
- Will specify role and responsibilities for Change Control & Issue management
- Records
- Timing of activities
- Assessment scales

Change Authority - The responsibility for agreeing to implement a change  
Change Budget - The method for funding changes
Project Board - By default make decisions, but may delegate limited authority for day-to-day changes to the PM

Configuration Item Records 
Documented information about a product and includes:
- Status
- Version
- Variance 
(of each CI and the relationship between them)

Product Status Account
Describes the status of all products within a set of limits for example:
- Within a stage
- A whole project
- A particular product
- Or a set of products
  
Daily log
Problems or concerns that the PM can manage informally, where an issue requires formal consideration, an Issue Report will be created and documented in the Issue Register.

Issues Register

Issues reports
- Description
- Impact assessment
- Recommendations for:
   - Request for Change
   - Off-Specification
   - Problem/Concern

### Change Control Procedures
A common and systematic approach for dealing with:
- Requests For Change
- Off-specifications
- Problems or Concerns

### 5 Step Process

1. Capture
- Analyse issue to see if it can be handled informally?  If so note in Daily Log and resolve.
- If the issue required a more formal approach, and Issue report should be raised and entered into the Issue Register.
  - Issue Report
  - Issue Register
  - Daily Log

2. Assess
The issue will be subject to an Impact Analysis to determine the impact on:
- Project performance targets (time, cost, quality, scope)
- Project Business Case (especially the impact on benefits)
- Project Risk Profile (e.g the impact of the overall risk exposure of the project)
  - Risk Profile > Issue Register (results entered into the Issue Register) > Issue Report

3. Propose
Once we understand the issue, we need to consider the most appropriate course of action:
- There are often a number of options for consideration and each most be reviewed on its effect on:
Suggested actions:
- Effects on time, cost, risks.

4. Decide
- Make a decision on the most appropriate course of action.
- The PM might be able to do this, or may escalate to the Project Board.

5. Implement
- Amend the plans or work packages to take the necessary action
- Create exception plan (for approval by the Project Board)

# Progress (Theme)

"To establish mechanisms to monitor and compare actual achievements against those planned in order to provide a forecast for the project objectives, including its continued viability and control any unacceptable deviations"

Progress ensures that for each level of the management team, the level above can:
- Monitor progresss
- Compare achievement with plan
- Review plans and options against future situations
- Detect problems
- Identify risks
- Initiate corrective action
- Authorise further work

### Controls

Prince2 provides 2 types of Controls throughout the project:

- Time Driven (defined frequency)
  - Checkpoint reports (from Team Manager)
  - Highlight reports (to Project Board during the stage, so no need for progress meetings during the stage)
- Event Driven (when a specific event occurs)
  - Exception report (to the Project Board if an exception situation is forecast)
  - End stage report
  - Authorising a Stage Plan

Project Board Controls
- Authorisations
  - Initiation
  - Project
  - Stage
  - Closure
- Highlight Reports (prepared by PM using info from Checkpoint Reports (Team level), which are in turn produced as Work Packages are completed).
- Exception Reports
- Issue Reports (early warning of any forecast deviation beyond tolerance levels, and issues requiring their attention).
- Exception Assessment (jointly considers what action to take in a response to a forecast deviation).

Project Manager 
- Authorisations
  - Work Packages (including setting WP tolerances)
- Progress Updates 
  - Checkpoint reports from team managers or members
- Exceptions and Changes (use of)
  - Daily Log
  - Issue Register
  - Product Status Account
  - Quality Register
  - Risk Register
  - Update Lessons Log and Lessons Reports are issues as appropriate within the project, and definitely at the end of the project.

### Tolerance

Projects don't always go 100% according to plan and minor departures from plan will frequently occur.  
To enable a project to run smoothly, without frequent and unnecessary communication between the different levels within the project team, Prince2 defines tolerances: 

- Time
- Cost
- Scope
- Quality
- Risk
- Benefit

Tolerances are allocated initially by Corporate / Programme Management, then managed and implemented by the 3 levels of management in the project:
1. Project Board (Directing)
2. Project Manager (Managing)
3. Team Manager (Delivering)

Programme / Corporate Management sits outside the project, but sets the overall **Requirement** and **Tolerance Levels** for the project.

The Project Board has overall control at a project level so long as forecasts remain within project tolerances and will also allocate tolerance for each Management Stage to the PM.  The Project Board has the ability to review progress and decide whether to continue, change or stop the project. If project tolerances are forecast to be exceeded, the Project Board can request advice from Corporate / Programme Management in order to get a decision on corrective action.

> Any forecast breaches of project tolerance should be escalated (Issue and Exception Reports)

Tolerance for Time, Cost Scope are set in Project Plan, Stage Plans and Work Packages.
Tolerance for Risk is set in Risk Management Approach, Stage Plans and Work Packages.
Tolerance for Quality is set in the Project Product Description and Product Descriptions.
Tolerance for Benefits is set in the Business Case.

### Minimum Requirements for Progress Theme

- Define its approach to controlling progress in the PID
- Be managed in stages
- Set tolerances and be Managed by Exception against these tolerances
- Review the Business Justification when exceptions are raised
- Learn Lessons to improve performance

Control in the project is provided by:
- Delegating authority downward through the team structure (Corporate / Programme > Project Board > Project Management > Team Manager)
- Divide the project in to Management Stages
- Having in place Time-driven (Checkpoint/Highlight) and Event-driven (Exception/End Stage) progress reporting.
- Raising exceptions

# Processes Model (7)

[Process Model Diagram](https://www.knowledgetrain.co/res/ebooks/prince2-process-model.pdf)

Num | Process| Description
------ | ------ | ------
1 | SU Starting Up a project | Do we have a viable and worthwhile project?
2 | IP Initiating a Project | Initiation activities
3 | CS Controlling a Stage | Used by PM allocate work and monitor and control progress 
4 | MP Managing Product delivery | Used by delivery teams to accept the work, complete it and hand it back
5 | SB Managing a Stage Boundary | Used by PM to plan the work of the next management stage
6 | CP Closing a Project | Used by the PM to handover the projects products to the Customer and close the project 
7 | DP Directing a Project | Used by the Project Board to make decisions and provide advice and guidance

## Starting up a Project (SU)
 
Purpose is to ensure that the prerequisites to Initiating a Project are in place, by answering the question "Do we have a viable and worthwhile project?"

The aim is to do the minimum necessary to determine if the project is worthwhile to proceed.

Project Mandate (Input/Trigger)
- Varies in format, could include a feasibility so extensive, or short less formal request.
:arrow_down:\
Starting up a project (SU) - Outline business case\
:arrow_down:\
Project Brief
- Mandate is refined into the Project Brief during SU.
- Project Brief is extended and refined during IP to create the PID.

### Key Objectives of the SU Process (7)
1. There is business justification for moving into IP.
  - Documented in the **Outline Business Case**
2. All the required authorities exist for Initiating a Project
3. There is enough information available to define and confirm the scope of the project within the Project Brief.
4. The ways the project can be delivered has been reviewed and a suitable project approach selected.
5. We have appointed individuals to do the work of IP
  - And/or take significant project management roles in the project.
6. We have planned the work to be done in IP.
7. We are not wasting time Initiating a Project based on unsound assumptions.

### SU Activities (6)
1. Appoint the Executive of the Project Board (first) and the PM.
2. Capture previous lessons (Lessons Log created from previous relevant lessons and subsequent lessons added)
3. Design and appoint the Project Management Team
4. Prepare the **outline** Business Case (and Project Product Description) - This is the justification and both will be refined during the Initiation Stage.
5. Select the project approach and assemble the Project Brief (Project Mandate develops into the Project Brief and states the Scope and Definition of the project).  The way in which the solution will be delivered is described in the Project Approach which is done alongside the Project Brief during the Select the Project Approach and Assemble the Project Brief activity.
6. Plan the Initiation Stage (Plan for initiation stage (identify and schedule) to make sure the work taking place in the Initiation Stage is understood as it will take time and consume resources). 

### Outputs for SU
1. Project Management Team
2. Project Brief
3. Project Approach
4. Plan for Initiation Stage
5. Lessons Log 
6. Daily Log

## Initiating a Project
"Establishes solid foundation for the project so that the organisation can underatand the work that needs to be done to deliver the project's products before committing to significant expense"

### Objectives of IP (10)
1. The reason for doing the project, the benefits expected and the associated risks.
2. How and when the project's products will be delivered and at what cost.
3. How the quality required will be achieved.
4. How risks, issues and changes will be identified, assessed and controlled.
5. How progress will be monitored and controlled.
6. The scope of what is to be done and the products to be delivered.
7. Who is to be involved in the project decision making.
8. How baselines will be established and controlled.
9. How the Corporate, Programme Management or Customer method will be tailored to suit the project.
10. How needs information, in what format and at what time.

> By using IP we can lay down the **foundation** required to achieve a successful project and makes sure the Project Board can decide if the project is sufficiently aligned with Corporate, Programme or Customer objectives.

Initiating a Project provides Stakeholders:
- What? What it must achieve
- Why? Why it is needed
- How? How the outcome will be achieved
- Who? Who will be involved and their responsibilities.

> If the Customer/Supplier relationship is Commercial, further consideration will be required.

Using the outputs from SU, the Project Initiation Documentation (PID) is assembled during the final activity of Initiating a Project (IP).  

### The IP process comprises of 9 activities:

1. Agree the tailoring requirements
2. Prepare the Risk Mgmt Approach
3. Prepare the Change Control Approach
4. Prepare the Quality Mgmt Approach
5. Prepare the Communications Mgmt Approach
6. Prepare the Benefits Mgmt Approach
7. Setup the project Controls
8. Create the Project Plan
9. Prepare the benefits Mgmt Approach
10. Assemble the Project Initiation Documentation (PID)

The below are approved by the Project Board at the end of the IP process:
- Project Initiation Documentation (PID)
- Benefits Mgmt Approach
- Next Stage Plan

## Controlling a Stage (CS)

"To assign work to be done, monitor such work, deal with issues, report progress to the Project Board and take corrective actions to ensure that the management stage remains within tolerance"

- Forms the main part of the PM work
- Provides direction for the day-to-day management of the stage, and the overall project
- Usually the CS process is first used once the Project Board has authorised the project
- But may also be used in the Initiation stage especially in large or complex projects
- Risk and issue are kept under control
- The business case is kept under review

Throughout a Management Stage, **Controlling a Stage** is uses the below activities to create a cycle of:
- Work Packages 
  - Authorising Work Package (signing-off)
  - Review Work Package status
  - Receive completed Work Packages
- Monitoring & Reporting
  - Review stage status
  - Report Highlights
- Issues (reviewing and triggering new WP's if appropriate)
  - Capture and examine issues and risks 
  - Escalate issues and risks
  - Take corrective actions (any action taken to maintain the project schedule, e.g modifying an existing WP or creating a new one)
  
> Issues that can be managed informally should be noted in the Daily Log, otherwise they should be entered into the Issue register and analysed further.

> Risks go into the Risk Register, if the issue or risk cannot be resolved within tolerance, escalate to the Project Board via an Exception Report using the "Escalate issues and risks" CS activity.

### CS Process Objectives (5)
1. The attention is focused on delivering the products
  - Movement away from the direction agreed at the start of the stage is monitored
2. The risks and issues are kept under control
3. The Business Case is kept under review
4. The agreed products are delivered to the stated:
  - Quality standard
  - Within Cost, Time and Effort targets
  - In support of the agreed benefits
5. That the project management team is focused on delivery within the tolerances

## Managing Product Delivery (MP)

Purpose "Control the link between the PM and the Team Manager or Managers, by agreeing the requirements for acceptance, execution and delivery"

- Where the Team undertake the work itself
- The Team Managers can be internal or external
- The planned products are delivered to expectations and within tolerance
- Work on products allocated to the team are authorised and agreed

### MP Process Objectives (5)
1. That the work on products allocated to the team is authorised and agreed.
2. That the Team Managers, team members and Suppliers are clear about:
  - What will be produced
  - What is the expected effort, cost or timescales
3. That the planned products are delivered to expectations and within tolerances
4. That accurate progress information is provided to the PM at an agreed frequency (to ensure expectations are managed).

### The MP process comprises of 3 activities:
1. Accept work package
2. Execute work package
3. Deliver work package

### The CS and MP processes interact as the project progresses, for example:
- The CS activity "Authorise a WP" hands off to the MP activity "Accept a WP"
- As work progresses in the MP activity "Execute a WP", checkpoint reports will be issued by the Team Manager to the PM who will review them in the CS activity "Review WP status"
- When the work is completed, the Team Manager will advise the PM by the MP process "Deliver WP", and the PM will consider this in the CS activity "Receive competed WP" and will ensure all the work has been completed before signing off the WP.
- Throughout the above interactions, the PM will perform daily monitoring and reporting via 2 activities:
  - Review the Management Stage Status (PM looks at the big picture of the project, looking at what has happened (Actual) vs what was expected (Planned).
  - The PM will then review the next chunk of work and make sure risks and issues are under control, and if necessary triggering corrective action.
- At a frequency defined by the Project Board, the PM will issue a Highlights Report to inform the board of progress (as described in the Report Highlights CS activity).

## Managing a Stage Boundary (SB)

Purpose "Enables the PM to provide the Project Board with sufficient information to:"

- Review the success of the current Management Stage.
- Approve the next stage plan.
- Review the **updated project plan**.
- Confirm the continued business justification and acceptability of risks.
- The process is executed at or close to the end of each Management Stage.
- Exception plans are prepared in SB and submitted to the Project Board for approval (in the same way as a Stage Plan).
- Prepares for the End Stage Assessment with the Project Board

> Because not all projects go to plan. It is possible the project could request to re-plan the project or stage at SB.

### SB Process Objectives (normal course of events)
1. Assure the Project Board that all products in the current Stage Plan have been completed as defined.
2. Prepare the Stage Plan for the Next Stage
3. Review and if necessary update the **PID**, in particular:
- Business Case
- Project Plan
- Project Approach
- Project Manager Team Structure and Role Descriptions
4. Provide the information needed for the Project Board to assess the continuing viability of the project.
5. Record any Lessons or information that can help later stages or other projects.
6. Request authorisation to start the next management stage.

### SB Process Objectives (when dealing with Exceptions)
1. Review and if necessary update the PID, in particular:
- Customer Quality Expectations
- Project Approaches
- Controls
- Role Descriptions
2. Provide the information needed for the Project Board to assess the continuing viability of the project.
3. Prepare an Exception Plan
4. Seek approval to replace the project or stage plan for the current stage with the exception plan.

> SB is not used in the final stage of the project **unless** an **exception plan is needed**.  This is because the activities needed to review the whole project and the performance of the final stage are included within the **Closing A Project** process.

### SB Activities
Normal - Activities
- Plan the next stage management stage
- Update the Project Plan
- Update the Business Case
- Report management stage end
Normal - Outputs
- End stage report
- Next stage plan
- Request to approve next stage plan

Exception - Activities
If a stage or project is in exception the firsts activity will be replaced with:
- Produce an exception plan
Exception - Outputs
- Exception Plan
- End stage report (optional and if requested by the Project Board)
- Request to approve exception plan

> The Outputs of Managing a Stage Boundary (SB) feed into the **Directing a Project Process**, in particular the activity **Authorise Stage or Exception Plan**

## Closing a Project (CP)

If an undertaking is to be managed as a Project, by definition it must be finite and come to a clearly defined end. Otherwise an Operational Management Approach (Ops) might be more appropriate.

Purpose "In any event the purpose of CP is:"
- To provide a fixed point at which acceptance for the project is confirmed.
- To recognise that objectives set out in the original project initiation documentation have been achieved.
- Or to recognise that any approved changes to these objectives have been achieved.
- Or to recognise that the project has nothing more to contribute.

### CP Key Objectives
- To verify the users have accepted the projects products.
- To ensure that the host site is able to support the products when the project is closed (in other words there is an Operation Support function in-place to maintain the products in BAU).
- To **review the project's performance** against its **baseline**.
- To assess any benefits that have already been realised:
  - And update the **Benefits Management Approach** to include **Benefit Reviews** (after the project has been closed).
- To ensure that follow-on action recommendations have been made to deal with any open issues and risks.
  - Eg. Risks associated with the use of the product
  - Or maybe a change that has been deferred until after the project is completed.
  
### CP Context
- Projects should always come to an end.
- A clear end to a project is always better than a slow drift into use.

CP provides us with an opportunity to:
  - Recognise that th eoriginal or changes objectives have been met.
  - Make sure everyone knows the project is finished.
  - Make sure that BAU takes over:
    - Or the products form an input into another project with a programme.
  - Disband the team
  - Make sure we do not continue to book time and cost to the project.
  
Closure activities should be planned as part of the stage plan in the final stage of the project.
  
Once the Project Board has confirmed the project closure, the Executive (who is a member of the Board) should notify the Corporate / Programme Management or the Customer that the Project is Closed.
  
If for any reason the Project is brought to a premature close, the CP process will still be executed, but some tailoring might be required.

### CP Activities (5)
1. Prepare planned closure
- PM ensures the expected results of the project have been acheived
- Have we done everything?
- Has the acceptance criteria been met?
- Are we in a position to hand over the projects products?
2. Prepare premature closure
- PM ensurs an orderly close
- And anything that can be salvaged has been
- And whatever remains to be done has been accuratly recorded for Corporate / Programme Management or the Customer.
3. Handover products
- The products are handed to the customer and operational environment.
- And the PM ensures that plans are in place to realise the benefits.
4. Evaluate the project
- PM evaluates the project against the PID as baseline at the end of the Initiation stage
- And creates an **End Project Report** and a **Lessons Report** (outputs)
5. Recommend project closure
- Finally, the PM should recommend to the Project Board that the Project is closed using the recommended Project Closure activity.

> Closing a project is planned as part if the planning for the final management stage of the project.

## Directing a Project (DP)

Purpose "To enable the Project Board to be accoutable for the projects sucesss by making key decisions and exercising overall control while delegating the projects day-to-day management to the PM"

- DP runs from the end of SU process to the very end and final closedown of the project. 
- DP is used exclusiverly by the Project Board who should:
  - Manage by Exception
  - Monitor through reports provided by the PM
  - Control via a series of key decision points
  
### DP Activities (5)
1. Authorise initiation
  - Approves the work undertaken during SU
    - Business Case
    - Project Approach
    - Project Brief
    - Plans for Initiation Stage
2. Authorise the Project
- Approves the Outputs of the Initiation Stage
  - Risk Mgmt Approach
  - Change Control Approach
  - Quality Mgmt Approach
  - Communications Mgmt Approach
- Makes sure the project has sound foundations before making any major commitments.
3. Authorise Stage or Exception Plan
- Approves the plans for the next stage, or if in Exception, the Exception Plan will require approval. 
4. Give Ad-Hoc direction
- Covers the informal communication with rthe Project Board
- And enables them to respond to reports during a stage
5. Authorise project closure
- Enables the Project Board to be sure that the project has been completed to their satisfaction, before disbanding the project team and infrastructure.
- If the project has been closed prematurely, this process is still compelted to make sure the project is brought to an end in a efficent manner.

### DP Process Objectives
- There is authority to initiate the project
- There is authority to deliver the projects products
- The necessary management and control is provided and the project remains viable.
- The Corporate / Programme Management or the Customer has an interface to the projects, provided via the Project Board.
- There is authority to close the project
- The plans for realising the post-project benefits are managed and reviewed

Fundimenatlly, this means: 
- The Project Board is the decision making body for the project.
- Each stage of the project is authorised
- The PM is supported
- And there is focus on the projects benefits and their realisation
