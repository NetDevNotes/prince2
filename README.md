Prince2 Foundation Notes

- Principles (7)
- Themes (7) 
- Proceses (7)

# A Project Defined

Prince2 assumes there will be a Customer who specifies the desired results and a Supplier who provides resources and skills to deliver these results.

> Customer Supplier Environment

The organisation that commissions a project is *Corporate*, *Programme Mgmt* or the *Customer*.  They are also responsible for governance and realising the projects benefits.

A project can be standalone or part of a programme (and as such subject to the programmes governance, structure & reporting requirements).

> "A programme is a group of related projects which deliver outcomes and benefits related to the organisations strategy"

> "A project can be part of a portfolio of strategic objectives"

# Project Performance (6)

## 6 aspects of project performance to be managed

1. Scope (everything needed to buy/build and all the work involved in doing it.  Also include what is out of scope to set stakeholders expectations.
2. Quality (defines the standards which the delivered scope must meet to be fit for purpose)
3. Risk (things might not go to plan, positive or negative, threats or opportunities) 
4. Cost (Project budget)
6. Time (Duration of the project)
6. Benefits (Measurable improvement in BAU because of the project)

# Principles (7) 

1. Continued business justification (Business Case)
2. Learn from experience (learn from previous projects or previous management stages)
3. Defined roles and responsibilities (Stakeholders - Business Sponsors, Users, Suppliers (int/ext))
4. Manage by stages (discreet sequential stages, do a little work, review, do a little more, review and so on until completion.)

> "The section of the project the Project Manager is managing on behalf of the Project Board at any one time, at the end of which the Project Board will wish to review progress to date, the state of the project plan, the business case and risks, and the next stage plan, in order to decide whether to continue the project"

## Management Stages (2 minimum)

- Initiation (thinking)
- Rest of the project (doing)

Management stages could be aligned with delivery stages, such as design, build and test.

Delivery stages may overlap each other, i.e. build and training may overlap somewhat, but management stages are always sequential (mgmt-stg-1, mgmt-stg-2, mgmt-stg-3, mgmt-stg-4). 

Typically you can break up the delivery stage that crosses management stage boundaries into smaller chunks (training syllabus in mgmt-stg-1, training staff in mgmt-stg-2).

The number of stages will depend on the size and complexity of the project, the risk, organisational standard and policies and where significant decisions are needed usually before a major commitment is made, such as *awarding a contract*.

Smaller stages offer more control to the project board who are the key decision makers, but also required more effort on their part.

Benefits of Managing by Stages
- Making sure the project is properly initiated before work starts
- Giving the Project Board the opportunity to assess the projects viability at defined intervals
- Making sure key decisions are made before the work starts (such as awarding contracts)
- Clarifying the impact of external influences on the project before the go-ahead is given
- Delegating authority to the Project Manager on a stage by stage basis - *Management by Exception*

5. Manage by exception (Tolerances are set for each aspect of performance, Cost, Time, Scope, Quality, Risk, Benefits. If within tolerances o need to meet.  Immediately escalate when forecast is expected to exceed a tolerance).
6. Focus on products (focus on definition, delivery and quality requirements of products)

> Products = Outputs = Deliverables

> "A product is an input or output, whether tangible or intangible, that can be described in advance, created and tested".

*Management Products* - Required and created to manage the project
*Specialist Products* - Created by the project to satisfy the business need

Benefits of Focus on products
- Ensures the project only undertakes work that directly contributes to the delivery of a product
- Helps manage uncontrolled change ny ensuring that all changes are reviewed before being accepted
- Reduces the risk of user complaints and disputes by establising the deliverables at the start of the project.

> Product Descriptions are used to clearly define the product

7. Tailor to suit the project

# Themes (7)

Num | Theme | Description
------ | ------ | ------
1 | Business Case | Why are we doing the project?
2 | Organisation | Who is involved, what are their responsibilities?
3 | Quality | What are the quality requirements and how will they be judged?
4 | Plans | What, when and how much?
5 | Risk | What may or may not happen that may affect the projects objectives?
6 | Change | What impact does an issue have? How will it be dealt with?
7 | Progress | Where are we now? Where will we be?

## Plans (3) 

3 levels of plan are suggested:

1. Project Plan - Created during the Initiating a Project process
2. Stage Plans - Initiation stage plan, then subsequent stage plans
3. Team Plans

Exception Plans can be part of the Project or Stage plans.

> Without a plan there is no control

Plans provide stakeholders:

- What products need to be delivered
- The risks - Opportunities & threats
- Issues with the definition of the scope
- Which people, specialist equipment & resources are needed
- Are targets for time, cost, quality, scope, risk & benefits achievable (the 6 aspects of performance)

Plans need to contain:

- What has to be produced
- What has to be done to produce it
- What has to be done to produce it correctly
- When will it be produced
- How progress will be monitored 
- What has to be donâ€™t to control risks

### 7 Planning Steps

1. Designing a plan - Decide the number of stages, the format of the plan and the links to the programme or portfolio. 
2. Defining and analysing the products - Using the Product Based Planning technique (see Product Based Planning below)
3. Identifying acivities and dependancies - Defining the work required (what we have to do) and their dependancies between them.
4. Preparing estimates - Duration of each activity
5. Preparing a schedule
6. Analysing risks to a plan (covering steps 2-5) - Consider risks to the plan and any mitigating actions should be included in the schedule.
7. Document the plan - What it contains, its constraint and monitoring an control arrangements etc.

### Plan Minimum Requirements

- Ensure the plans enable the Business Case to be realised.
- Have at least 2 Management Stages (Initiation Stage and rest of the Project)
- Produce a Project plan for the whole project and a Stage Plan for each Management Stage.
- Use the Product Based Planning technique for the Project, Stage and Exception plans, and optionally Team plans.
- Produce specific plans for managing exception
- Define the roles and responsibilities for planning
- Use lessons to inform planning
- Create and maintain the 4 Product Based Planning products (See Product Based Planning below)
- The Product Flow Diagram is also recommended, but optional.

### Project Plan

Created during the *Initiating a Project* process and is a *high-level* view of the full project, comprising of:

- Key milestones
- Resource requirements
- Overall cost estimates
- Overall time estimates

Defined as:

> A high-level plan showing the major products of the project, when they will be delivered and at what cost. An initial Project Plan is presented as part of the *project initiation documentation or PID*. This is revised as information on actual progress appears,  It is a major control documentation for the Project Board to measure actual progress against expectation.

The Project Plan provides a statement of how the below targets are to be acheived:

- Time
- Cost
- Scope
- Quality
- Identifies major control points, such as management stages and milestones.

And identifies the major products, activities and resources required for the project.

> The Project Plan is used within the Business Case and is used by the Project Board as a baseline to monitor progress stage-by-stage, and should align with Corporate/Programme Managements plan.

### Stage Plan (for each management stage)

*Initiation Stage Plan* is created in *Starting Up a project* and subsequent stage plans are created within *Managing a stage Boundary*.

A stage plan is required for each management stage and each stage plan is finilaised near to the end of the previous stage. This provides more confidence as the stage plan is produced close to the time when the planned events will take place. Stage plans are performed with the benefit of hindsignt of the performoance of earlier stages and are much shorter in duration than the project plan.

Defined as:

> A detailed plan used as a basis for project management control throughout a management stage.

### Team Plan (optional)

Covers the work of the team during a stage and are *optional*.  A format is not prescribed for Team Plans as there may be more than one team on a project possibly from differnt organistions, with differnt internal plan processes.

Team Managers produce Team Plans in parallel with the production of a stage plan, or when a Work Package has been accepted during the Managing Product Delivery process.

### Exception Plan 

When predicted that a plan will no longer finish within the agreed tollerances and exception plan may be produced to replace that plan. The exception plan is prepared at the same level of detail as the plan it replaces, at either Project or Stage level. Once approved it becomes the new baselined project or stage plan.

Exception plans pick up from the current plans actuals and continues to the end of that plan.  Exception plans are not produced at Team level.

If a work package is forecast to exceed its tolerances, then provides it can be resolved within the stage tolerances, the Project Manager will ammend or replace the work package in question.

Exception plans require approval from the *Project Board* to replace a *Stage Plan*, and *Corporate/Programme Management* to replace a *Project Plan*.

## Product Based Planning (use for all plans)

### 4 Products must be produces and maintained (in order)

1. Project Product Description
2. Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)
3. Product Description
4. Plan
5. *Recommended* Product Flow Diagram (Link between product based planning and activity based planning)

### Project Product Description

### Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)

### Product Description

Headings | Description
-------- | ---------
Identifier | A unique key
Title | The name by which the product is known
Purpose | Why do we need this product
Composition | What will make up the product
Derivation | Where will the product come from
Format & Presentation | What form will it take
Development Skills Required | What skills will be required
Quality Criteria | What are the key quality factors
Quality Tolerance | Is the quality of the product acceptable
Quality Method | How will quality be judged
Quality Skills Required | Who is qualified to check the product
Quality Responsibilities | Who are the Producers, Reviewers & Approvers

### Product Flow Diagram

The Product Creation Sequence is depicted in the Product Flow Diagram which is used to show the order in which products must be created.

Product = Rectangle
External Product = Ellipse/Circle

Time flows in one direction, either from top to bottom or left to right.

# Risk 

# Risk (Theme)

"An uncertain event that, should it occur, will have an effect on the acheivement of objectives.  It consists of a combination of the probability of a perceived threat or opportunity occuring, and the magnitude of its impact on objectives."

Threat = Risk with negative impact (Oil price soar!)
Opportunity = Risk with positive impact (Oil price slump!)

Identified - Clearly describing the risks, so there is a common understanding.
Assessed - Ranking risks in terms of estimated probablility, impact and timing or proximity.
Planned for - Identifying suitable answers to risks and assigning owners.
Controlled - By making sure the responses are implimented, monitored and controlled.

Risk Principles (9)

1. Understanding the project context
2. Involve the stakeholders
3. Establishing clear project objectives
4. Developing a project risk management approach
5. Reporting on risks regularly
6. Defining clear roles and responcibilities.
7. Establishing a support structure and a supportive culture for risk management.
8. Monitoring for early warning indicators.
9. Establishing a review cycle and seek cintinued improvement.
